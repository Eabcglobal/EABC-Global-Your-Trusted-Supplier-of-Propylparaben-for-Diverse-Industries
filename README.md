What is Propylparaben?
Propylparaben (C10H12O3) is a chemical compound commonly used as a preservative in cosmetics, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and food. As a member of the parabens family, it helps prevent the growth of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms, thereby extending the shelf life of products. Propylparaben is typically used in formulations where product stability is critical, such as lotions, creams, shampoos, deodorants, and even some oral medications.
Its effectiveness in inhibiting microbial growth, combined with its low toxicity and relatively mild scent, has made it a staple in formulations across multiple industries.
